function space_points=triangulation3D(Pcam,image_points)
%TRIANGULATION3D Triangulation of N 3d points from their image projections
% in M>1 images. The triangulation is initially computed by the DLT algorithm.
%
%  Input arguments:
%  Pcam         - M-cell of projection 3x4-matrices
%  image_points - 2MxN-matrix with the image points in each image OR
%                 3MxN-matrix with the image points in each image with
%                 homogeneous coord
%  Output arguments:
%  space_points - 4xN-array containing the 3d estimated positions (in
%                 homogeneous coordinates) of the image points.
